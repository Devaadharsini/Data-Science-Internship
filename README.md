TASK 1 :
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population. 
Dataset used for Task 1 : Shop Customer Data 
Dataset name : Customer.csv

Task-02: 
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 
Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 

My analysis included:

- Descriptive statistics and correlation between variables
- Visualizations to uncover patterns and trends 

Key insights:
1.Explored the relationship between gender and survival rate 
2.Analyzed age distribution by ticket class and gender 
3.Examined class-based fare structure

TASK 3: 
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Dataset name : Bank Marketing dataset
Dataset link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

1)Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed Age based on Job and Marital status
- Examined Number of Previous Contacts by Communication Type and Campaign Outcome
- Analyzed Frequency of Contacts during Campaign by Communication Type and Campaign Outcome
- Studied Average Yearly Bank Balance distribution by Education and Campaign Outcome

3)Data Preparation

- After splitting data into input variables and target variable, found unique values in each categorical variable
- Mapped categorical data into numeric form
- Created a correlation matrix of input variables

4)Model Building

-Trained a Decision Tree Classifier 
-Achieved an accuracy of 96%

5)Model Evaluation

-Evaluated model performance with classification report and visualized it through heatmap
-Predicted customer purchases using unseen data
